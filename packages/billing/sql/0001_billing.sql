-- @aimhuge/billing 0001 — subscriptions, invoices, payment methods, profiles,
-- the audit log and webhook idempotency.
--
-- Copy into an app's supabase/migrations under a new timestamp (see the
-- package README); `create ... if not exists` makes it a no-op where the
-- tables already exist (DeckCP, which these were extracted from).
--
-- Everything here MIRRORS the payment provider's state. `provider` +
-- `provider_*_id` say which upstream object a row reflects; the mock and
-- Stripe write the same rows, so reads never change.
--
-- Money is integer minor units (cents). Metered usage is micros, in 0002.
--
-- `plan` is free text: each app's TypeScript catalog is the vocabulary, and an
-- unknown value reads as the free plan. An app may add its own check
-- constraint (DeckCP: free | pro | team).
--
-- Service-role-only: RLS on, no policies. Reads and writes go through the
-- app's own gate, and mutations additionally require owner/admin there.
--
-- Assumes the app has public.orgs(id uuid), public.org_memberships(org_id,
-- user_id, role, created_at) and public.profiles(id, email) — the shared
-- workspace model.

-- ── Subscriptions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One row per org, created lazily on first billing read (an org with no row is
-- free — see ensureSubscription). PK on org_id, not a surrogate id: an org has
-- exactly one live subscription, and making that a constraint rather than a
-- convention means a double-submitted checkout upserts instead of duplicating.
